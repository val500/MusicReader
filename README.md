# Sheet Music Reader
This project is designed to read in sheet music and play the associated notes.

## Usage
``` bash
python3 main.py "filename" num_lines
```

## Info

This is the repository containing the algorithm and datasets for our CS 4476 project.

To use the algorithm to find the note names on a one line staff, change the name of the image in the scan_image method in read_music.py to one of the other names of generated music sheets in the repository. Add the line print(scan_image()) to the end of the read_music.py file to print out an array containing the note values for all of the notes on the staff.
